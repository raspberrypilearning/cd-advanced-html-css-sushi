## Introduction

This Sushi Series will show you how to make a website look polished and professional with cool effects and layouts. 

### What you will make

Add something here to showcase here, for example:

<div class="scratch-preview">
  <iframe allowtransparency="true" width="485" height="402" src="https://scratch.mit.edu/projects/embed/160619869/?autostart=false" frameborder="0"></iframe>
</div>

Add instructions here. These should explain either how the finished project will work, or explain how to interact with the content above.

### What you will learn

You'll learn tricks to make any layout you want, see how to make it adjust itself automatically to different screen sizes, make a collage of overlapping pictures and text, and apply some neat hover and click effects that you might have seen on other websites.
