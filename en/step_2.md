## Getting Setup

To work through the Sushi Cards you will need to start with a website that you already made. For example you can use the one that you made in the Intermediate HTML and CSS series. If you prefer, you can work with my example by either **Downloading** or **Remixing** this trinket: [dojo.soy/html3-website-start](http://dojo.soy/html3-website-start)

For a website with lots of code, like this one, you may find it easier to work with an offline text editor on your computer. If you prefer to work online and access your code from any device, go to [dojo.soy/html3-trinket](http://dojo.soy/html3-trinket) and create an account or sign in. It is free to create an account on Trinket; all you need is an email address.
